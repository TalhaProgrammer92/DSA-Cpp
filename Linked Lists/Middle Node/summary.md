## ✅ **Main Purpose of the Code**

This program builds a **singly linked list**, prints it, and **finds the middle node** of the list using its `middle()` method.

---

## 🔍 Breakdown of Important Parts

### 🧱 `class Node`

```cpp
class Node {
public:
    int value;
    Node *next;

    Node(int value) : value(value), next(NULL) {}
};
```

* Represents each individual node.
* Holds an integer `value` and a pointer `next` to the next node.

---

### 🧱 `class LinkedList`

Manages all linked list operations.

#### 🔹 Constructor

```cpp
LinkedList() : head(NULL), tail(NULL) {}
```

* Initializes an empty list.

---

### 🔹 `push_front(int value)`

Adds a new node **at the beginning** of the list.

```cpp
void push_front(int value)
{
    Node *node = new Node(value);

    if (head == NULL)
        tail = node;
    else
        node->next = head;

    head = node;
}
```

* If list is empty, both `head` and `tail` point to the new node.
* Otherwise, links new node to current head and updates `head`.

---

### 🔹 `int size()`

Calculates and returns the **number of nodes** in the list.

```cpp
int size()
{
    int count = 0;
    Node *start = head;

    while (start != NULL)
    {
        start = start->next;
        count++;
    }

    return count;
}
```

* Traverses the list and counts the nodes.

---

### 🔹 `Node* at(int index)`

Returns the **node at a specific index** (0-based).

```cpp
Node* at(int index)
{
    if (head != NULL)
    {
        Node *start = head;
        for (int i = 0; i < index; i++)
            start = start->next;

        return start;
    }

    throw out_of_range("The given index is out of range!");
}
```

* Loops through the list until the desired index is reached.
* Throws an error if list is empty.

---

### 🔹 `Node* middle()`

Returns the **middle node** of the list.

```cpp
Node* middle()
{
    if (head != NULL)
    {
        Node *start = head;
        int mid = size() / 2;

        return at(mid);
    }
}
```

* Calls `size()` to get the total number of nodes.
* Finds middle index using `size() / 2`.
* Uses `at()` to get the node at that index.

> If size is even, it returns the **second middle** node (e.g., for 6 nodes, it returns node at index 3).

---

### 🔹 `print()`

Displays all the values in the list.

```cpp
void print()
{
    Node *start = head;

    while (start != NULL)
    {
        cout << start->value << "->";
        start = start->next;
    }
    cout << "NULL" << endl;
}
```

---

## 🧪 `main()` Execution

```cpp
int main()
{
    LinkedList list;

    list.push_front(6);
    list.push_front(5);
    list.push_front(4);
    list.push_front(3);
    list.push_front(2);
    list.push_front(1);

    list.print();

    cout << "Middle Node value: " << list.middle()->value << endl;
}
```

### 🧠 Step-by-step:

1. Values inserted: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL`
2. The middle index: `size() / 2 = 6 / 2 = 3`
3. The node at index 3 is **4**, so output is:

---

## ✅ **Final Output**

```
1->2->3->4->5->6->NULL
Middle Node value: 4
```

Certainly! Here's a **detailed explanation** of the `middle_slow_fast()` function using the **"slow and fast pointer" approach**:

---

## ✅ **Purpose of the Function**

Find the **middle node** of a singly linked list in a more **efficient way** than the previous `size()/2` method.

---

## ⚙️ **Core Idea – Two-Pointer Technique**

* Use **two pointers**:

  * `slow`: moves **1 step** at a time.
  * `fast`: moves **2 steps** at a time.

* When `fast` reaches the **end** of the list, `slow` will be at the **middle**.

> This works because `fast` travels twice as fast as `slow`, so by the time `fast` covers the full list, `slow` has covered half.

---

## 🔍 Line-by-Line Breakdown

```cpp
Node *middle_slow_fast()
{
    if (head != NULL)
    {
        // ? Get two pointers
        Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
```

* Both `slow` and `fast` start at the head of the list.

---

```cpp
        // ? Treverse the list
        while (fast != NULL)
        {
            if (fast->next == NULL)
                break;

            slow = slow->next;
            fast = fast->next->next;
        }
```

* The loop continues **as long as `fast` hasn't reached the end**.
* Inside the loop:

  * First, it checks if `fast->next` is `NULL`. If yes, the list has an odd number of nodes and `fast` is at the end.
  * If not, it moves `slow` one step forward.
  * Then moves `fast` two steps forward.

---

```cpp
        return slow;
    }

    return NULL;
}
```

* After the loop ends, `slow` is pointing to the middle node, which is returned.

## 📌 Example Walkthrough

For list: `1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> NULL`

| Iteration | slow | fast             |
| --------- | ---- | ---------------- |
| Start     | 1    | 1                |
| 1         | 2    | 3                |
| 2         | 3    | 5                |
| 3         | 4    | NULL (or beyond) |

* `slow` stops at **4** — the middle node (same result as the previous approach, but faster and cleaner).

---

## 🆚 Comparison with size/2 approach

| Approach      | Time Complexity | Space Complexity |
| ------------- | --------------- | ---------------- |
| `size()/2`    | O(n + n)        | O(1)             |
| `slow & fast` | O(n)            | O(1) ✅           |

* The `slow & fast` pointer method is **more efficient** because it makes **only one traversal**.

---

## ✅ Final Verdict

This version is:

* Cleaner ✅
* Faster ✅
* No need to calculate size ✅
* Handles both even/odd-sized lists well ✅
