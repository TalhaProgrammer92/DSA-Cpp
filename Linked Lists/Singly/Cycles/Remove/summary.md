It removes a **cycle (loop)** in a **singly linked list**. It first **detects the cycle** using **Floyd's Cycle Detection** (Tortoise and Hare), then it **identifies the node where the cycle begins**, and finally, it **removes the cycle** by setting the previous node’s `next` to `NULL`.

---

### 🧠 Step-by-Step Explanation Using the Code

We’ll use this example linked list with a cycle:

```
1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5
         ↑     ↓
         ←←←←←←
```

Here, node `5` links back to node `3`, creating a cycle.

---

### 🔹 Step 1: Detect if a cycle exists

```cpp
Node *slow = head, *fast = head;
bool cycle = false;

while (fast != NULL && fast->next != NULL)
{
    slow = slow->next;
    fast = fast->next->next;

    if (slow == fast)
    {
        cycle = true;
        break;
    }
}
```

* `slow` and `fast` start at node `1`.
* After a few iterations:

  * `slow` moves: 1 → 2 → 3 → 4
  * `fast` moves: 1 → 3 → 5 → 4 → 3
* Eventually, `slow == fast` inside the cycle at node `4` or `3` → **Cycle detected!**

---

### 🔹 Step 2: If no cycle → return

```cpp
if (!cycle)
    return;
```

* In our case, a cycle **was detected**, so we skip this `return`.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Find the node where the cycle starts

```cpp
Node *prev;
slow = head;

while (slow != fast)
{
    slow = slow->next;
    prev = fast;
    fast = fast->next;
}
```

* `slow` restarts at head (node `1`), `fast` continues from where the cycle was found.
* Both now move one step at a time:

  * slow: 1 → 2 → 3
  * fast: 4 → 5 → 3

At node `3`, `slow == fast`. So, **node `3` is the start of the cycle**, and `prev` is node `5`, which points to `3`.

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Remove the cycle

```cpp
prev->next = NULL;
```

* `prev` (node `5`) was pointing to `3`, creating the loop.
* Now `prev->next = NULL` breaks the loop:

  ```
  1 → 2 → 3 → 4 → 5 → NULL
  ```

---

### ✅ Final Result

* The list is now a proper singly linked list without any cycle.

### 🧮 Time and Space Complexity

| Aspect           | Value  |
| ---------------- | ------ |
| Time Complexity  | `O(n)` |
| Space Complexity | `O(1)` |

Just like detection, this method works in linear time and constant space.
