# Introduction
DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) is a fundamental concept in computer science that focuses on organizing, storing, and processing data efficiently. **Data Structures** like arrays, linked lists, stacks, and trees help in managing data, while **Algorithms** are step-by-step procedures for solving problems, such as searching, sorting, and graph traversal. Mastering DSA improves problem-solving skills and optimizes code performance, making it essential for software development and technical interviews.

# Flowchart
### **Flowchart Overview**  
A **flowchart** is a visual representation of a process or algorithm using symbols to show the flow of execution. It helps in understanding logic, debugging, and designing algorithms effectively.  

### **Common Flowchart Symbols**  
- **Oval** → Start/End  
- **Rectangle** → Process (Calculation/Operation)  
- **Diamond** → Decision (Yes/No, True/False)  
- **Arrow** → Flow Direction  

### **Example: Flowchart for Finding the Largest of Two Numbers**

This flowchart takes two numbers as input, compares them, and prints the larger one.

# Pseudo Code
### **What is Pseudocode?**  
Pseudocode is a **high-level, human-readable** representation of an algorithm, written in a way that resembles programming logic but without strict syntax rules. It helps developers plan and understand algorithms before writing actual code.  

### **Key Features of Pseudocode:**  
- Uses **simple language** to describe logic.  
- Does not follow **specific programming syntax**.  
- Uses **indentation** to show hierarchy and structure.  
- Helps in **converting logic into real code** easily.

### **Example: Pseudocode for Finding the Largest of Two Numbers**  

```plaintext
BEGIN
    PRINT "Enter two numbers: "
    READ A, B
    IF A > B THEN
        PRINT "Largest number is: ", A
    ELSE
        PRINT "Largest number is: ", B
    ENDIF
END
```

### **Pseudocode Symbols & Conventions:**  
| **Keyword**  | **Meaning** |
|-------------|------------|
| `BEGIN` / `END` | Start and stop the algorithm |
| `READ` / `INPUT` | Take user input |
| `PRINT` / `DISPLAY` | Show output |
| `IF - ELSE` | Conditional decision-making |
| `WHILE`, `FOR` | Loops for iteration |

Pseudocode is useful for **planning algorithms** before implementing them in a programming language like C++, Python, or Java.
