# Brute Force Approach
## **Definition**  
The brute force approach is a straightforward method of solving a problem by trying all possible solutions until the correct one is found. It does not use optimization techniques or shortcuts; instead, it relies on raw computation power.  

## **Real-Life Example**  
Imagine you forget the 4-digit PIN for your phone. A brute force approach would be to try every possible combination from `0000` to `9999` until you find the correct one. This is inefficient because it could take up to 10,000 attempts to unlock the phone.  

## **Why It's Not the Best Approach?**  
1. **Time Complexity** – It is often very slow for large inputs because it examines all possibilities.  
2. **Inefficiency** – It wastes computational resources by not eliminating unnecessary computations.  
3. **Not Scalable** – As the input size grows, the number of possibilities increases exponentially, making it impractical for large problems.  

## **Better Alternative**  
Optimized algorithms like **Divide and Conquer, Dynamic Programming, or Greedy Algorithms** reduce unnecessary computations and improve efficiency.
