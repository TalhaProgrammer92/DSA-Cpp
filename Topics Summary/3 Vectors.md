# **Vectors in C++ as a Data Structure**  

## **What is a Vector?**  
A **vector** in C++ is a **dynamic array** that can **automatically resize** itself when elements are added or removed. It is part of the **STL (Standard Template Library)** and provides more flexibility than arrays.  

---

## **Characteristics of Vectors**  
✔ **Dynamic Size** – Can grow or shrink automatically.  
✔ **Contiguous Memory** – Similar to arrays for cache efficiency.  
✔ **Efficient Access** – Elements can be accessed in **O(1)** time using an index.  
✔ **Built-in Functions** – Comes with useful functions like `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`, etc.  

---

## **Declaration and Initialization in C++**  
### **1. Declaring a Vector**
```cpp
#include <vector>
vector<int> v;  // Declares an empty vector of integers
```
### **2. Initializing a Vector**  
```cpp
vector<int> v = {10, 20, 30, 40, 50}; // Initializing with values
vector<int> v(5, 100); // Vector of size 5 with all values as 100
```

---

## **Accessing and Modifying Elements**  
```cpp
cout << v[0];        // Accessing element at index 0
v.push_back(60);     // Adds 60 at the end
v.pop_back();        // Removes the last element
cout << v.size();    // Prints the size of the vector
```

---

## **Advantages of Vectors**  
✔ **Dynamic Resizing** – Unlike arrays, they can grow and shrink.  
✔ **Built-in Functions** – Makes operations easier (`push_back()`, `size()`, `clear()`).  
✔ **Memory Management** – Allocates memory efficiently.  

## **Disadvantages of Vectors**  
❌ **Extra Memory Usage** – Resizing may cause overhead.  
❌ **Insertion/Deletion Cost** – Middle insertions/deletions require shifting, which is **O(n)**.

# **Difference Between Arrays and Vectors**  

| Feature       | Arrays | Vectors |
|--------------|--------|---------|
| **Size** | Fixed | Dynamic (Auto Resizes) |
| **Memory Allocation** | Contiguous, Fixed | Contiguous but can expand |
| **Flexibility** | Cannot resize | Can grow/shrink dynamically |
| **Insertion/Deletion** | Costly (O(n)) | Easier with `push_back()` (O(1)) |
| **Built-in Functions** | No | Yes (e.g., `push_back()`, `pop_back()`, `size()`) |
| **Performance** | Faster (No overhead) | Slight overhead due to resizing |

# **Example: Array vs Vector in C++**

### **Using an Array**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    int arr[5] = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    for (int i = 0; i < 5; i++) {
        cout << arr[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

### **Using a Vector**
```cpp
#include <iostream>
#include <vector>
using namespace std;

int main() {
    vector<int> v = {1, 2, 3, 4, 5};
    v.push_back(6);  // Adding an extra element

    for (int i = 0; i < v.size(); i++) {
        cout << v[i] << " ";
    }
    return 0;
}
```

# **Conclusion**  
- Use **arrays** when the size is known and fixed for better performance.  
- Use **vectors** when dynamic resizing and flexibility are needed.
